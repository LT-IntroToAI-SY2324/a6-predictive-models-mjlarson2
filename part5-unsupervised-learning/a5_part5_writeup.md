# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
High-Spending Low-Income (HSLI), High-Spending High-Income (HSHI), Low-Spending Low-Income (LSLI), Low-Spending High-Income (LSHI), and Average-Spending Average-Income (ASAI). I would choose these grouping names because they are self-explanatory and thus easily understandable
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
A customer with a medium income and low spending would likely be in the ASAI group.
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
The marketing team might approach the LSHI group by offering high-quality reliable products that appeal to those who can afford to pay larger amounts but who don't want to spend frivilously, as the longer lifetime of these products could appeal to the more frugal-minded high-income individuals.
