# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312, meaning that this linear regression model explains the majority of the variation in the data.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

The predicted blood pressure for someone who is 43 is 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

This model's predictions are probably pretty accurate and decenty reliable, since the r value indicates a pretty strong correlation
and the r squared value indicates good coverage of the variance in the data.
