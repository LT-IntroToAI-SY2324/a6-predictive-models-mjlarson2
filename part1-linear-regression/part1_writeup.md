# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312, meaning that this linear regression model has a weak correlation.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

The predicted blood pressure for someone who is 43 is 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

This model's predictions are probably somewhat accurate, but may not be wholly reliable, since the r squared value does not indicate a
particularly strong correlation between age and blood pressure. This model could probably be improved by having more training data,
or taking other factors into account (like having different graphs based on possible medical histories, or other important factors).
